# Eye Gaze Based Hands-Free Locomotion Technique for VR

This is a Unity3D project I created to design an eye gaze based hands-free virtual locomotion technique in virtual environments. The code uses Unity version 2018.01.3, and all scripts are written in C#. Eye tracking data is collected using the Pupil Labs eye tracker for the HTC vive. To learn about the Pupil Labs eye tracker and it's implementation in Unity check pupil labs demo [here](https://github.com/pupil-labs/hmd-eyes).
